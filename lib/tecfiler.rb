# DataMapper.auto_migrate!

# This will issue the necessary CREATE statements (DROPing the table first, if it exists) to define each storage
# according to their properties. After auto_migrate! has been run, the database should be in a pristine state.
# All the tables will be empty and match the model definitions.

# This wipes out existing data, so you could also do:

DataMapper.auto_upgrade!

# This tries to make the schema match the model. It will CREATE new tables, and add columns to existing tables.
# It won't change any existing columns though (say, to add a NOT NULL constraint) and it doesn't drop any columns.
# Both these commands also can be used on an individual model (e.g. Post.auto_migrate!)
